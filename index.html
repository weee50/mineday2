              Welcome to MineDay Season 2!<br>
              This was a project I made in 2020 intended to be a sequel to MineDay, but with the Minesweeper engine programmed from scratch.<br>
              However, I never did much with it, so there are only three weeks here. I just never got the motivation.<br>
              That also explains why this website looks significantly worse than the original.<br>
              Anyway, here are the weeks:<br><br>
              <a href="0">Week 0: Warmup</a><br>
              <a href="1">Week 1: Double Inverse Mines</a><br>
              <a href="2">Week 2: Odd Numbers</a>
            </center>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </center>
